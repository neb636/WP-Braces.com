Braces (Dynamic)
===========

Braces is a starter theme that is meant for getting development teams up and running on WordPress projects quickly. Braces is derived from [Automattic _s project] (https://github.com/Automattic/_s). _s is truly a fantastic project and much of the core beliefs behind _s will land in this project as well.

However, we did deviate a bit in a way that suited our business needs and hopefully you find it helpful as well. Some of the main features you can find in addition are [Sass] (http://sass-lang.com) intergration, file and structure clean up, and most noticeably, the PHP syntax. Typically any new additions should have readme docs for their explanations.

Pull requests are welcome!

Why Braces?
---------------

Braces alters the typical WP PHP loop syntax for a more [PHP coding standards] (http://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/coding-standards/php/) approach using more, well, "braces".

Getting Started
---------------

To run the dynamic theme build you need Ruby 2.1.0 or higher

To start the build process cd into the top level of this theme and type "ruby builder.rb"

To learn more about Gulp please go to https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/blob/master/README.md

Now you're ready to go! The next step is easy to say, but harder to do: make an awesome WordPress theme. :)

Good luck!
